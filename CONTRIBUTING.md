# CONTRIBUTING

You are more than welcome to submit issues and merge requests to this project.

## git branches

Master branch is protected from pushes and may only accept fast-forwarded merge
from develop. Owners and masters are allowed to merge develop in master.

Develop branch  is protected from pushes.  It is the actual  working branch and
any kind of features  or bug fixes should be merged  to develop first.  Owners,
masters and developers are allowed to merge other branches to develop.  Masters
are allowed to push if and only if there is a real need (eg when develop branch
has to be rebased).

Anyone can  create a  new branch  for his own  needs. The  names of  the branch
should include the issue number if there is any issue related.

## tests

Your commits must not break any tests.

## commits format

Your commits must pass `git log --check` and messages should be formated
like this (based on this excellent
[post](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):

```
Summarize change in 50 characters or less

Provide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the
summary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.

If the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final
paragraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format
below.
```

Also  do your  best to  factor  commits appropriately,  ie not  too large  with
unrelated things  in the  same commit, and  not too small  with the  same small
change applied  N times in  N different commits.  If there was  some accidental
reformatting or  whitespace changes during  the course of your  commits, please
rebase them away before submitting the MR.

## files

All files must be 80 columns width formatted (actually 79), exception only when
it is really not possible.
